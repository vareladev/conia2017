						  <p style="text-align:justify; width:95%">
							Production systems represent a source of job opportunities, and the production of goods and services is required to achieve development. Nevertheless, making sustainable industrial processes is a challenge that demands innovation. Under this topic the congress will present the proposals focused on promoting efficient production and manufacturing systems through new and best products and processes, supervision, and control of industrial processes, strategies for a clean production, energy efficiency in the processes, as well all those ideas for a sustainable and inclusive industry.

							During the congress, the UCA aims to promote the construction of sustainable, efficient and functional infrastructure. Some alternatives to promote the optimization of resources in order to solve serious problems of the country in this area such as housing shortage, and transport infrastructure. Under this topic, we are especially looking for studies or ideas of new construction materials, structural repair and reinforcement in existing buildings. We also looking for infrastructure resilience, which looks to develop infrastructure able to resist adverse environmental situations like this caused by strong earthquakes.
